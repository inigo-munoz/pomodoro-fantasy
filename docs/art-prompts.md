# Pomodoro Fantasy — Art Prompt Pack (Frost / Dark-Fantasy edition)

Note: the slot once called `corner` is now `center`; the prompts below keep the old name.

Art direction: the whole app is themed around ONE frost dragon, in the glacial,
mystical, dark-fantasy watercolor world of the reference character (the antlered
frost-elf your daughter loves). Cold but friendly and enchanting — never scary,
never gory.

## How to use
1. Open the reference character illustration in ChatGPT and attach it to EVERY
   prompt as a **style reference**. Say: "Match the art style, mood and colour
   palette of the attached image. The SUBJECT is different (see below)."
2. Generate the BABY dragon first. Regenerate until you love it.
3. For YOUNG, attach the baby image too and ask for "the SAME dragon, older".
4. For ADULT, attach the young image and ask for "the SAME dragon, grown up".
   Chaining by reference keeps colour, shape and features consistent so it reads
   as ONE dragon growing.
5. Always ask explicitly for a **transparent background**. If one still appears,
   remove it afterwards.
6. Save each as PNG into `art-src/dragons/`, `art-src/foods/`, `art-src/icons/`
   (the high-res originals — these are git-ignored, kept only on disk).
7. Optimize each PNG to a small `.webp` (this repo's shipping format):
   ```
   convert art-src/<group>/<name>.png -resize 512x512 -quality 82 \
     -define webp:method=6 public/art/<group>/<name>.webp
   ```
   1024px watercolor at 512 is indistinguishable on a tablet and ~40× lighter.
8. The code is already image-ready — point the `image`/`icon` strings in
   `src/data/dragons.js` / `foods.js` to `/art/<group>/<name>.webp`.

Each prompt below is COMPLETE and standalone — attach the reference image and
paste one prompt as-is. Save with the filename in its heading.

## Dragons (save to art-src/dragons/)

The dragon's FIRST phase is ALWAYS an egg (level 1), then it hatches and grows:
egg → baby → young → adult. Every dragon needs its own egg image too.

### UI icons — dragon-themed fire (save to art-src/icons/)

**Icons follow different rules from dragons and food.** The first attempt reused the
illustration prompt for the icons and every one of them failed: ornate lava filigree,
flames licking around the object, every element in the same orange hue against the
near-black theme background. At the ~32px they actually render at, they became
undifferentiated orange blobs — a side-by-side against the frost icons at identical
size made it obvious. Detail per pixel is the enemy at icon size.

Prefix every icon prompt below with these rules:

```
These are UI ICONS, not illustrations. ONE bold simple silhouette that is instantly
recognisable at 32x32 pixels. Thick chunky shapes. NO filigree, NO ornament, NO lava
cracks, NO flames or sparks around the object, NO texture noise, NO thin lines. Strong
value contrast: keep the CORE of the shape LIGHT — bright cream, pale gold, light warm
orange — so it pops against a near-black warm background. Dark outlines only. Soft
watercolor shading inside the silhouette only. Square 1:1, centered, front view, plain
fully transparent background, PNG, no text, no scenery, no ground shadow.
```

#### blaze-coin.png
```
SUBJECT: a single gold coin, flat-on front view, a thick round disc with a raised rim in bright pale-gold and cream with dark outlines, and one simple small dark dragon silhouette stamped in the centre. Nothing else. No flames, no sparks, no ornament around the rim.
```

#### blaze-shop.png
```
SUBJECT: a treasure chest, three-quarter front view, lid open, bright pale-gold coins mounded inside — a simple chunky chest shape that reads as a chest at a glance.
```

#### blaze-settings.png
```
SUBJECT: a cog / gear wheel, front view, flat-on, with 8 thick chunky teeth and a big round hole in the centre — bright pale-gold and cream metal with dark outlines, unmistakably a gear at a glance. No runes, no flames, no ornament inside it.
```

#### blaze-mute.png
```
SUBJECT: a mute icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in bright pale-gold and cream with dark outlines, and one thick bold diagonal slash crossing straight over it. Nothing else. No sound waves, no flames, no sparks.
```

#### blaze-break.png
```
SUBJECT: a rest / take-a-break icon — a chunky sleeping baby dragon curled into a simple round ball, head tucked down, eyes closed as two simple curved lines, one small wing folded over its back. Bright pale-gold and warm cream body with dark outlines, one clear round silhouette. No embers, no flames, no sparks, no scenery.
```

Note: `break` is used twice — as the small Break button icon AND as the large resting
dragon art shown during a break — so it has to hold up at both sizes. A clear round
silhouette with a light core does.

## Thorn — the forest dragon (third dragon)

Art direction: Thorn is the living, growing counterpart to Frost and Blaze. SAME
dark-fantasy children's storybook watercolor style, SAME friendly-not-scary mood — a deep
woodland palette: dark forest green and moss, bark brown, fern and new-leaf green, with
warm amber light filtering through leaves and soft golden pollen motes. Enchanted, cosy,
alive — NOT scary, NOT gory. Subtle leaf, vine and tiny-flower motifs. Same pipeline:
transparent PNG → `art-src/<group>/thorn-*.png` → 512px webp in `public/art/<group>/`.
Cutout model per subject: dragon character → `isnet-anime`; discrete objects/icons/food →
`isnet-general-use`.

Blaze icon section above for why this matters:

recognisable at 32x32 pixels. Thick chunky shapes. NO filigree, NO ornament, NO texture
noise, NO thin lines, nothing floating around the object. Strong value contrast: keep the
CORE of the shape LIGHT — cream, pale gold, pale leaf green — so it pops against a
near-black deep-green background. Dark outlines only. Soft watercolor shading inside the
silhouette only. Square 1:1, centered, front view, plain fully transparent background,
PNG, no text, no scenery, no ground shadow.
```

## Tempest — the storm dragon (fourth dragon)

Art direction: Tempest is AIR read as a STORM, deliberately not the pale cyan-and-white
wind dragon — that reading is visually Frost, and the chooser has to be readable at a
glance. SAME dark-fantasy children's storybook watercolor style, SAME friendly-not-scary
mood — a storm palette: deep slate and charcoal violet, electric violet-indigo, cloud
silver and pale grey, with bright lightning-yellow accents. Enchanted, exhilarating,
friendly — NOT scary, NOT menacing. Subtle swirling-wind and small lightning-arc motifs.
Same pipeline: transparent PNG → `art-src/<group>/tempest-*.png` → 512px webp in
`public/art/<group>/`. Cutout model per subject: dragon character → `isnet-anime`;
discrete objects/icons/food → `isnet-general-use`.

SUBJECT: a cog / gear wheel, front view, flat-on, with 8 thick chunky teeth and a big round hole in the centre — cloud silver and pale lilac metal with dark outlines, unmistakably a gear at a glance. No sparks, no clouds, no ornament inside it.
```

#### tempest-mute.png
```
SUBJECT: a mute icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in cloud silver and pale lilac with dark outlines, and one thick bold diagonal slash crossing straight over it. Nothing else. No sound waves, no sparks.
```

#### tempest-break.png
```
SUBJECT: a rest / take-a-break icon — a chunky sleeping baby storm dragon curled into a simple round ball, head tucked down, eyes closed as two simple curved lines, one wispy wing folded over its back. Cloud-silver and pale lilac body with dark outlines, one clear round silhouette. No sparks, no clouds, nothing floating around it.
```

## Sound-on icons — the missing second state (all four dragons)

The mute button has only ever had ONE icon: a speaker that is ALREADY crossed out. So it
reads "silenced" even while sound is playing, and the button cannot show its own state
through its symbol. `mainScreen.js` now distinguishes the states by brightness, but the
real fix is a second icon per theme.

Save each as `art-src/icons/<name>.png` and ship the 512px webp to `public/art/icons/`.
Frost keeps the unprefixed naming its other icons use.

Prefix every prompt with the icon rules block used for that dragon's other icons — these
sit next to the mute icon at the same size and must match it exactly in weight and finish.

#### sound.png — Frost
```
SUBJECT: a speaker icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in pale ice-blue and frost-white with dark outlines, and two bold curved sound waves arcing off its right side. NO slash, NO bar across it. Nothing else.
```

#### blaze-sound.png
```
SUBJECT: a speaker icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in bright pale-gold and cream with dark outlines, and two bold curved sound waves arcing off its right side. NO slash, NO bar across it. Nothing else.
```

#### thorn-sound.png
```
SUBJECT: a speaker icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in pale cream and light leaf-green with dark outlines, and two bold curved sound waves arcing off its right side. NO slash, NO bar across it. Nothing else.
```

#### tempest-sound.png
```
SUBJECT: a speaker icon — a chunky speaker shape (a square body with a triangular cone) in cloud silver and pale lilac with dark outlines, and two bold curved sound waves arcing off its right side. NO slash, NO bar across it. Nothing else.
```

Wiring these up, once the four files exist:
1. add `sound: '/art/icons/<name>.webp'` to each theme's `icons` in `src/data/themes.js`
2. add a `sound` entry to `themes.default.icons` (a `'🔊'` emoji) so the fallback resolves
3. in `src/ui/mainScreen.js`, pick the key by state: `themedIcon(theme, state.muted ? 'mute' : 'sound')`

## The Dragon Lair — room backgrounds and furniture (44 assets)

Art direction: the lair is the dragon's home. Each of the four themes gets ONE room
background plus ten pieces that are placed into it — SAME dark-fantasy children's
storybook watercolor style, SAME friendly-not-scary mood, each theme in its own palette
and setting: Frost = ice cave, Blaze = lava cave, Thorn = forest hollow, Tempest = storm
eyrie. Cosy, warm-hearted, lived-in — NOT scary, NOT gory, NOT gloomy.

44 assets in total: 4 room backgrounds (`<theme>-room.png`) + 10 items x 4 themes
(`<theme>-<id>.png`). The ten ids are the ones in `src/data/furniture.js`: `banner`,
`painting`, `trophy` (wall); `bed`, `nest` (floorLeft); `lamp`, `chest`, `shelf`
(floorRight); `imp`, `hatchling` (corner — these two are PETS).

### How to use (lair)
1. Work ONE THEME AT A TIME. Generate the **room** first (attach the reference character
   illustration as the style reference, as in "How to use" above). Regenerate until the
   room is calm and lovely.
2. Then generate that theme's ten items, **attaching the finished room image as the
   style reference** (plus the reference character for the first one if the style drifts).
   Say: "Match the art style, brushwork, lighting and colour palette of the attached
   room. The SUBJECT is a piece of furniture for that room." This is the same chaining
   idea as egg -> baby -> young -> adult: a theme's furniture must belong to its own
   room, not just to the app. Do not mix themes — never attach a Frost room while
   making a Blaze item.
3. Items are saved as PNG into `art-src/lair/` (high-res originals, git-ignored, kept
   only on disk), alongside the rooms.
4. These are hard requirements that come from how the code composites the art, not
   matters of taste:
   - **Transparent background for every ITEM.** The four room backgrounds are the ONLY
     opaque assets in this pack. Ask explicitly for a transparent background on items and
     remove any that appears afterwards. No floor, no wall, no cast shadow, no glow halo
     baked into the item.
   - **The room is square** (rendered 420x420 CSS px) and the dragon stands at its centre,
     about 40% of the width. The **centre of every room background must stay visually
     calm** — no busy focal point, no pool, bolt, fire or bright light where the dragon
     will stand. Put detail at the edges and corners.
   - **Items sit at fixed positions** over the room: `wall` sits high and centred;
     `floorLeft` and `floorRight` sit low at the sides; `corner` sits at a corner. Each
     item is drawn at roughly **22% of the room's width**, on a tablet, at arm's length.
     **Silhouette matters more than detail at that size.** One bold readable shape, thick
     chunky forms, strong value contrast, no tiny parts, no thin lines, and keep the item
     centred with a little margin inside a square 1:1 canvas.
   - **Pets (`imp`, `hatchling`) must look ALIVE and CONTENT.** Awake, smiling, bright-eyed,
     round and well-fed, relaxed and happy where they are. NEVER hungry, sad, sleepy-lonely,
     sick, thin, scared, caged, chained, leashed, tied up, in a bowl, or in need of care. No
     tears, no drooping posture, no empty food dish, no cage bars. The game rejects any
     mechanic that makes a child feel guilty, and the art must not bring that feeling back.
5. Optimize each PNG to a small `.webp` (512px, same as everywhere else):
   ```
   convert art-src/lair/<theme>-<name>.png -resize 512x512 -quality 82 \
     -define webp:method=6 public/art/lair/<theme>-<name>.webp
   ```
   Shipping paths are `/art/lair/<theme>-<id>.webp` (rooms: `/art/lair/<theme>-room.webp`).
   Items must keep their alpha channel; the room can be flattened. Cutout model if a
   background has to be removed: `isnet-general-use` for furniture, `isnet-anime` for
   the two pets.

Each prompt below is COMPLETE and standalone — attach the reference image(s) named in its
step and paste one prompt as-is. Save with the filename in its heading.


### Frost — ice cave (save to art-src/lair/)

Palette for every prompt in this theme: glacial palette (indigo, ice blue, frost white, bone grey, aurora teal, cyan glow).

#### frost-room.png
Opaque. Generate this FIRST for Frost; it becomes the style reference for the ten items below.
```
Match the art style, mood and colour palette of the attached reference image. Dark-fantasy children's storybook illustration, moody painterly watercolor. Glacial winter palette: deep indigo and midnight blue, ice blue, frost white, bone grey, soft aurora-borealis teal and green glow, gentle glowing cyan highlights. Subtle snowflake and frost motifs. Enchanted, cosy, friendly — NOT scary, NOT gory, NOT gloomy. Square 1:1 composition, FULL-BLEED OPAQUE background (no transparency), no text, no characters, no creatures, no furniture, no props. SUBJECT: the inside of a glacial ice cave seen straight on, as a calm square room — walls and a vaulted ceiling of pale blue ice with soft frozen ridges, a smooth frosted floor, a few distant icicles at the very top corners, a faint aurora glow seeping in from the upper left. Keep the CENTRE of the image a soft, empty, softly lit floor and wall with no focal point. The image is an empty room, waiting for a dragon to be placed in the middle: soft and quiet in the centre, gentle detail only toward the edges and corners, a clear floor area along the bottom third and a plain wall area high in the middle.

### Thorn — forest hollow (save to art-src/lair/)

Palette for every prompt in this theme: deep woodland palette (forest green, moss, bark brown, fern, amber light, golden pollen).

#### thorn-room.png
Opaque. Generate this FIRST for Thorn; it becomes the style reference for the ten items below.
```
Match the art style, mood and colour palette of the attached reference image. Dark-fantasy children's storybook illustration, moody painterly watercolor. Deep woodland palette: dark forest green and moss, bark brown, fern and new-leaf green, warm amber light, soft golden pollen motes. Subtle leaf, vine and tiny-flower motifs. Enchanted, cosy, friendly — NOT scary, NOT gory, NOT gloomy. Square 1:1 composition, FULL-BLEED OPAQUE background (no transparency), no text, no characters, no creatures, no furniture, no props. SUBJECT: the inside of a hollow in a giant ancient tree seen straight on, as a calm square room — curved walls of warm bark with a few soft roots and tiny flowers, a mossy floor, thin shafts of amber light and floating golden pollen near the top corners. Keep the CENTRE of the image a soft, empty, softly lit mossy floor and bark wall with no focal point. The image is an empty room, waiting for a dragon to be placed in the middle: soft and quiet in the centre, gentle detail only toward the edges and corners, a clear floor area along the bottom third and a plain wall area high in the middle.

## Record icon (the study record screen) — save to art-src/icons/

Added 2026-10-02 with the fourth nav button. These follow the ICON rules, not the
illustration rules: one bold silhouette legible at 32x32, a LIGHT core so it reads against a
near-black background, and no ornament of any kind. Verify every one by rendering it at 32px
over its own theme background before accepting it — not at 1024.

Subject for all four: a rolled-open parchment scroll, front on, a rod top and bottom, nothing
written on it. Only the rods and the outline carry the theme; the parchment core stays pale
cream in every theme.

### frost (the default set, saved as record.webp)

Generate a UI ICON, square 1:1, fully transparent background, PNG, centred, no text, no scenery, no ground shadow. SUBJECT: a rolled-open parchment scroll seen front-on, with a wooden rod at the top and bottom — a "record of what you did" icon for a children's app. This is an ICON, not an illustration. These rules outrank style and beauty: ONE bold, simple silhouette that is still recognisable as a scroll at 32x32 pixels. Thick chunky shapes only. NO filigree, NO ornament, NO thin lines, NO texture noise, NO sparkles, NO surrounding effects of any kind. The CORE of the shape must be LIGHT — pale cream parchment — so it pops against a near-black background. Dark outline around the silhouette. Shading only INSIDE the silhouette. Nothing written on the parchment. It is blank. Theme, applied only as a tint at the edges and the rods, never as clutter: glacial winter — deep indigo, ice blue, frost white, bone grey, with a faint cyan edge glow. Match the painterly storybook finish of the attached reference icon, but simpler and bolder than it. Output one image only.

### blaze / thorn / tempest

Same prompt, changing only the tint of the rods and the outline, and repeating the rules so
they are not forgotten:

- **blaze**: dark charred wood rods with a dull ember-orange edge, near-black outline, faint
  warm rim. Explicitly NO flames, NO lava cracks, NO sparks, and **do not make the parchment
  orange** — that is exactly how the first blaze icon batch failed.
- **thorn**: rods bound with dark green vine, moss-and-bark edge, deep forest outline. No
  leaves scattered around, no vines trailing off the silhouette.
- **tempest**: slate-grey rods with a cold violet edge, storm-dark outline. No lightning, no
  clouds, no sparks.

## Sleeping and wing-flap frames (all four dragons)

The break shows the player's OWN dragon at its OWN stage, asleep; the adult flaps its wings
when tapped. These are edits of the shipped originals, never new characters, so attach the
original PNG from `art-src/dragons/` (one image per chat, a fresh chat each time) and paste
the prompt as-is. The egg has no sleeping art: an egg does not sleep.

- Sleeping: `<dragon>-baby-sleep`, `<dragon>-young-sleep`, `<dragon>-adult-sleep`
  (attach `<dragon>-baby.png` / `-young.png` / `-adult.png`).
- Wings up: `<dragon>-adult-flap` (attach `<dragon>-adult.png`).

Do NOT let the art paint "z" letters: the stage already draws a drifting 💤
(`.dragon-stage.resting::after`), and painted ones would show twice.

#### Sleeping prompt (baby and young; for the adult say "calm and gentle" instead of "calm and cute")
```
Edit the attached image. Keep EXACTLY the same dragon character: same art style (dark-fantasy children's storybook watercolor), same colours, same palette, same markings, horns, wings and proportions, same line work and painterly texture, same size in the frame. Change ONLY the pose: the dragon is peacefully ASLEEP, curled up in a cosy ball with eyes gently closed, tail wrapped around its body, head resting on its paws, wings folded, calm and cute. No 'z' letters, no text. Centered, square 1:1, plain fully transparent background, PNG, no scenery, no ground shadow.
```

#### Wings-up prompt (adult only)
```
Edit the attached image. This is one frame of a wing-flap animation. Keep EXACTLY the same dragon character: same art style (dark-fantasy children's storybook watercolor), same colours, palette, markings, horns and proportions, same line work and painterly texture. Keep the head, body, legs and tail in EXACTLY the same position, pose and size in the frame, so it overlays the original perfectly. Change ONLY the wings: both wings raised high above the back, fully spread upward at the top of a flap, the dragon looking happy. No text. Centered, square 1:1, plain fully transparent background, PNG, no scenery, no ground shadow.
```

ChatGPT returns these already transparent, so no cutout model is needed. Same pipeline:
save to `art-src/dragons/<name>.png`, then the 512px webp into `public/art/dragons/`, and
point `sleepImage` / `flapImage` in `src/data/dragons.js` at it.
