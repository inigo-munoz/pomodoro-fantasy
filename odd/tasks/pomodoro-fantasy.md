# Pomodoro Fantasy: a front door, and a new name

## Objective

Give the app a title screen — POMODORO FANTASY, a Start button and a link to instructions —
and rename the product from Pomodoro Dragon to Pomodoro Fantasy, repository and URL included.

## Problem

The app opens straight into whatever state the save file left behind: the dragon chooser on a
first run, the timer otherwise. There is no front door, nothing that names the thing, and
nowhere that explains how it works. A child who has not used it in a month, or an adult seeing
it for the first time, gets a timer and a dragon and has to guess the rest.

## Decisions taken

| Decision | Value | Who decided |
|---|---|---|
| A title screen with Start and an instructions link | yes | user |
| Its name | Pomodoro Fantasy | user |
| Rename the whole product, repo and URL | yes | user, after being shown the cost |
| **The save key does NOT change** | `pomodoro-dragon-save-v1` | assistant — see below |
| The title screen appears on every launch | assistant — that is what a title screen is |
| Instructions written here, reviewed by the user | assistant |

### What the rename costs, corrected

When this was offered, the option said the save would be lost unless migrated. **That was
wrong, and the correction matters.** `localStorage` is scoped to the ORIGIN
(`https://inigo-munoz.github.io`), never to the path, and the key is a plain string with no
knowledge of the base path. Moving from `/pomodoro-dragon/` to `/pomodoro-fantasy/` keeps the
same origin, so the coins, the dragon, the lair and the record all survive by themselves.

What genuinely breaks is the **installed PWA**: `scope` and `start_url` in the manifest move to
the new path, so the app already installed on the tablet is orphaned and must be removed and
installed again. Its data is not the casualty; its shortcut is.

**Therefore the storage key stays `pomodoro-dragon-save-v1` forever.** It is the one string in
the codebase that must not follow the rename — changing it is the only action that would
actually throw away the child's progress. It needs a comment saying so, because it will look
like an oversight to the next person.

## Scope

**In scope**
- `src/ui/titleScreen.js`: the name, a Start button, a link to the instructions.
- `src/ui/instructionsScreen.js`: how the app works, in plain English, for a child.
- Routing: the title screen is the first screen on every launch; Start goes where the app
  used to go on load (the chooser with no dragon, the timer otherwise).
- The rename in `index.html`, `vite.config.js` (`base` and the manifest `name`/`short_name`)
  and `package.json`.
- Renaming the GitHub repository, then pushing so Pages rebuilds at the new path.

**Out of scope**
- Changing `config.storageKey`. See above. This is a hard constraint, not a preference.
- New art. The title screen uses what the app already has.
- A first-run-only variant, onboarding flow or tutorial overlay.
- Migrating or renaming anything inside the save file.

## Constraints

- Strict TDD. Runner `npm test -- --run`. Baseline: **28 files / 426 tests green**.
- RDD is off globally; ordinary checks only.
- UI copy stays English.
- The title screen must not assume a dragon exists: it renders before any choice is made, so
  it runs on the default palette, which has no backdrop and emoji icons.
- Every asset path goes through `assetUrl()`.
- `src/app.test.js` drives the app from load and will now meet the title screen first. Many of
  its tests will need to pass through it; do that with a helper, not by weakening assertions.

## Tasks

- [x] **F1. The two screens.** `4673321` `titleScreen.js` and `instructionsScreen.js`, in the idiom of
      the other screens. Instructions cover: work blocks and the break, the long break after
      four, coins for finishing work, food to grow the dragon, the lair and its shelf, and the
      record. No guilt language, per the rule frozen in `lairScreen.test.js`.
- [x] **F2. Make it the front door.** `f3ef149` The title screen is what `render()` shows on load; Start
      routes to the chooser or the timer exactly as before. Back from the instructions returns
      to the title screen.
- [x] **F3. The rename.** `f766957` `index.html` title, `vite.config.js` base and manifest, and
      `package.json`. **Leave `config.storageKey` alone**, with a comment explaining why.
- [x] **F4. The repository.** Rename on GitHub, push, verify FROM THE SERVER, and tell the user
      to reinstall the PWA on the tablet.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Launching the app shows POMODORO FANTASY with a Start button and an instructions link.
2. Start opens the dragon chooser when no dragon has been chosen, and the timer when one has.
3. The instructions explain every system the app has, and return to the title screen.
4. A save written before this change still loads afterwards with nothing lost.
5. The name reads Pomodoro Fantasy in the tab title and in the installed app's name.
6. `config.storageKey` is unchanged and a test pins it.
7. `npm test -- --run` green, `npm run build` succeeds.
8. The new URL serves the new bundle, verified by curl, not by opening the page.

## Checks

- `npm test -- --run` at the close of every task.
- `npm run build` before the rename.
- After pushing: compare the served bundle name against the local build, and curl the new
  assets for status, content-type and byte size.

## Progress

Branch `feat/pomodoro-fantasy`. F1-F3 done; **F4, the repository rename, is still open.**

| Commit | Subject |
|---|---|
| `4673321` | `feat(ui): a front door, and a page that explains the game` |
| `f3ef149` | `feat(app): open on the title screen` |
| `f766957` | `chore: rename the app to Pomodoro Fantasy` |

Observed: **31 files / 442 tests green** (baseline 426), `npm run build` succeeds and
`dist/index.html` references `/pomodoro-fantasy/`. The built manifest reads name
Pomodoro Fantasy, short_name Fantasy, with `start_url` and `scope` both `/pomodoro-fantasy/`.

### Manual smoke test — RUN AND PASSED (2026-10-02)

Against the dev server, restarted on the new base:

- Launch lands on the title screen, every time.
- Start with a dragon already chosen opens the timer; with none, the chooser. Both verified.
- The instructions open and Back returns to the title screen.
- The instructions read correctly and take every number from `config`: four blocks, one coin
  per minute, fifty coins for the Lair. They pass the no-guilt assertion.
- **The existing save loaded under the new name**, dragon `frost` intact. This is the proof
  that keeping `storageKey` was the right call.

### A thing I was wrong about, checked rather than assumed

"How it works" renders underlined in the back-button colour and looked like a raw browser link
with a poor tap target. Measured: it is a `<button>`, 132x48, so it already meets the 48px
floor. It is the app's existing secondary-control style, not a defect. Nothing was changed.

### Open question for the user

The Start button is green, because the title screen runs on the DEFAULT palette — no dragon
has been chosen yet, and `--accent` there is `#66cc33`. It is the only green on an otherwise
indigo screen. Correct by the rules, possibly not wanted.

### Follow-ups the user asked for after seeing it (`965d8ec`, `dbde0a3`)

- **Start opens the egg selection**, always, not only on a first run. The chooser marks the
  saved dragon, so carrying on is one tap. This broke 59 tests that press Start to reach the
  timer; the test helper now taps the saved dragon too, which replays what the child does and
  hides nothing. **It also surfaced a real defect**: confirming the dragon already in play
  rewrote the save file. Harmless when the chooser was rare, pure churn now that every launch
  goes through it, so `onPick` returns early on an unchanged id.
- **A painted front door.** Its own backdrop — a twilight valley with a distant dragon — not a
  theme backdrop, because the screen runs before a dragon exists. At mean luminance 42 against
  16-32 for the four themed ones it is the brightest of the set, so it is darkened top and
  bottom to keep the white title winning.
- **A fantasy display face**: Cinzel, SIL OFL, **self-hosted**. Google's CDN would be a network
  request an offline PWA cannot make. `woff2` had to join the workbox `globPatterns` or the
  font would not be precached and the front door would break offline — verified that the built
  CSS carries the base: `url(/pomodoro-fantasy/fonts/cinzel-700.woff2)`.
  It dresses `.app-title` and `.screen-title` ONLY. **The body stays on `system-ui`**: a child
  still learning to read should not have to decode an engraved serif to follow the
  instructions.
- **The green Start button is gone.** It came from the default palette's `--accent`, the one
  that runs before a dragon is chosen, and it fought the painting. The front door never changes
  theme, so literal parchment colours are safe there and borrow the language of the scroll
  icons.

Verified live: Cinzel actually loads (`document.fonts.check` true, not a fallback), the body
font is untouched, the backdrop layer is present, and Start reaches the four eggs.
**443 tests green**, build succeeds, precache 127 entries.

### A pipeline discovery worth keeping

The clipboard route failed here: with two tabs open the ChatGPT tab never held focus, and the
Clipboard API refuses an unfocused document. Poisoning the clipboard with a sentinel first is
what caught it — without that it would have written a stale image and shipped the wrong art.
**The working alternative needs no focus and no clipboard**: have the page build an
`<a download>` from the image's blob URL and click it. The file lands in `~/Downloads`. It also
costs nothing in context, unlike pulling base64 through the agent.

## Next step

None in code. Verified from the server on 2026-10-04: the remote is `pomodoro-fantasy`,
`https://inigo-munoz.github.io/pomodoro-fantasy/` serves `<title>Pomodoro Fantasy` with bundle
`index-u7NgIERj.js` containing the new title and the quests, and the old `/pomodoro-dragon/`
path returns 404. The user still has to reinstall the PWA on the tablet by hand.
